				<h2>How does YouTube choose what videos to promote?</h2>
				<p>Our recommendation system narrows down the best set of videos to offer your audience by paying attention to:
					<ul>
						<li>What they watch</li>
						<li>What they don’t watch</li>
						<li>What they search for</li>
						<li>Likes and dislikes</li>
						<li>‘Not interested’ feedback</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</li>

				<h2>How do I get my videos promoted to a bigger audience?</h2>
				<p>
					You don’t have to be an expert in algorithms or analytics to be successful on YouTube, instead, focus on knowing your audience. Our recommendation system doesn't promote videos to your audience but rather finds videos for your audience when they visit YouTube. Videos are ranked based on their performance and relevance to your audience, and not all videos are eligible to be recommended.
				</p>

				<h2>How are videos ranked on Home?</h2>
				<p>
					Home is what your audience sees when they open the YouTube app or visit YouTube.com. It's where we aim to deliver the most relevant, personalized recommendations to each viewer. When your audience visits Home, YouTube displays videos from subscriptions. Videos watched by similar viewers and new videos are also shown. The selection of videos is based on:
					<ul>
						<li>Performance -- How well your video has interested and satisfied similar viewers, among other factors.</li>
						<li>Watch and search history -- How often your audience watches a channel or topic and how many times we’ve already shown each video.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>Keep in mind that not all content is eligible to be recommended on the YouTube Home page.
				</p>

				<h2>How are videos ranked in Suggested under ‘Up Next’?</h2>
				<p>
					Suggested Videos are recommended alongside the video your audience is watching under ‘Up Next’. Suggested Videos are ranked to offer your audience videos they’re most likely to watch next. These videos are often related to the video your audience is watching, but they can also be personalized based on watch history.
				</p>
				<p>Keep in mind that not all content is eligible to be recommended on Watch Next pages.</p>
